# 🌍 Global Power Plant Trend Analysis

This project explores trends in global energy production using a dataset of power plants across various countries and energy sources. The goal is to visualize and analyze how different regions utilize energy resources, and predict future energy consumption patterns using machine learning.

---

## 📊 Project Highlights

- Cleaned and processed a global dataset of power plants
- Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover regional and source-based trends
- Visualized energy usage by country and continent using interactive charts
- Built predictive models to forecast future power generation trends
- Deployed insights to understand the shift toward renewable energy
